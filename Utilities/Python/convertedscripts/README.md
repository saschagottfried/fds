# Python Processing Scripts

This folder is part of a project to translate MATLAB scripts into Python scripts to avoid MATLAB bugs and allow our code to be available for people without a MATLAB license. These scripts are tested with Python 3.6.3, but should be compatible with any version of Python 3. These scripts were generated by using the MATLAB scripts from Utilities/Matlab/convertablescripts/ with [Pythonic SMOP](https://github.com/PatrickFURI/smop), occasionally with a handmade correction. To add more scripts, a MATLAB script from Utilities/Matlab/scripts/ should be copied to the convertablescripts folder. The script should be edited, if necessary, to generate working results with Pythonic SMOP (read the Pythoic SMOP documentation for more details). The final, working Python file should be added to this folder.
