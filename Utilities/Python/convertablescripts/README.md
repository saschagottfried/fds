# Convertable Processing Scripts

This folder is part of a project to translate MATLAB scripts into Python scripts to avoid MATLAB bugs and allow our code to be available for people without a MATLAB license. These scripts are used to generate the scripts found in Utilities\Matlab\pythonscripts\. See the README.md in that folder for more details.
